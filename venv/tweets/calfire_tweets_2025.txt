Content: The skies may be clearing, but dangers can remain after a wildfire. Ensuring public safety is our top priority. Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area.  

Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, and burned-out guard rails, and clearing significant wind-damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in. Your safety matters!
