Content: Understanding the distinction between an "evacuation order" and an "evacuation warning" is crucial for your safety. An evacuation warning indicates a potential danger to life and property, prompting readiness to evacuate. In contrast, an evacuation order denotes an imminent threat to life, mandating immediate departure as directed by law enforcement. It's essential to recognize these terms to respond effectively in emergency situations.
