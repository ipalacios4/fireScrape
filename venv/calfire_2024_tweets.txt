Content: Research suggests that creating a noncombustible buffer of five feet around your home can significantly improve the likelihood that it survives a wildfire. Creating a combustible-free Zone 0 that extends a minimum of five feet from each structure or, if applicable, an attached deck reduces the chance of wind-blown embers or radiant heat spreading the fire to your home. Remove bark and replace wood fencing and other potential fuel for sparks with noncombustible alternatives.

Content: (1/2) In 1984, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), in conjunction with the Connecticut State Police, developed a test program to establish the feasibility of using canines for Ignitable Liquid (IGL) detection. The study proved positive outcomes, and based on the information obtained, the @cal_office decided to adopt a similar program. Two black Labrador Retrievers named Sam and Bugs were obtained in May 1990 under the direction of State Fire Marshal James F. McMullen (1985-1992). These canines were assigned to Arson and Bomb Investigators and remained in service until retiring in 2001.

Content: In honor of National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week, this #CALFIREClassic highlights CAL FIRE's Emergency Command Centers (ECCs), which have evolved over several decades to become vital hubs for 911 dispatchers to coordinate emergency response efforts across California. 

In the early years of the California Division of Forestry (CDF), emergency response coordination was primarily decentralized, with individual units and stations managing incidents within their respective jurisdictions. As the complexity and scale of emergencies increased, there arose a need for centralized command and control facilities to facilitate more effective coordination and communication among responding units.

The establishment of the first formal ECCs can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s when CDF recognized the necessity of dedicated facilities equipped with advanced communication systems and personnel trained in incident management. These early ECCs served as nerve centers during large-scale incidents, providing a centralized location for incident commanders, operations personnel, and support staff to coordinate response efforts, allocate resources, and communicate with other agencies and jurisdictions.

Today, CAL FIRE operates a network of 21 state-of-the-art ECCs strategically located throughout California, each equipped with advanced communication systems, real-time monitoring capabilities, and trained personnel proficient in incident management protocols. They facilitate seamless coordination among CAL FIRE Units, local government agencies, federal partners, and other stakeholders, ensuring a swift and effective response to protect lives, property, and natural resources. #NPSTW #NPSTW2024 #Dispatchers #CommunicationsOperators

Early this week, the horse's caretaker called @CALFIRERRU to report a horse stuck in thick mud along the Santa Ana River. 

Due to the weather conditions and stability of the river shore, rescuers decided to hoist the horse back to safety.

With the help of @rivcafire, the city's animal rescue team, and Norco Animal Rescue, CAL FIRE Riverside prepped the horse for flight, which included blindfolding it.

A  @RSO helicopter lifted the horse from the river area and carried it dozens of feet above the ground back to its caretaker.

Thanks to this cooperative effort, Conquistador is safe and sound. #animalRescue #horse #helicopter

Content: “CAL FIRE” became the official shorthand for the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection on January 1, 2007, as a result of a bill that was passed unanimously by the legislature and signed by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

From the California Division of Forestry to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF), the organization charged with protecting state lands from wildfires has changed monikers several times over its nearly 140 years of existence.

“The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection may be referred to, where appropriate and as determined by the director, as CAL FIRE,” the legislation reads.

The purpose of the change was to provide more clarity on the bulk of the work performed by the department.

Today, the CAL FIRE logo adorns the more than 12,000 employees and thousands of pieces of equipment in our fleet.

Content: Fighting wildfires from the air takes precise coordination and expertise. Orchestrating this aerial ballet of tankers, helicopters, and intel aircraft are the Air Tactical Group Supervisors (ATGS). Trainees for this vital role learn the ropes at California Aerial Supervision Academy (CASA), which recently concluded.

The two-week intensive training, sponsored by CAL FIRE and held jointly with the @forestservice, included a week of classroom learning, flight simulator sessions, and orientation flights in Sacramento before those skills were put to the test in week two with scenario-based flights from CAL FIRE’s air attack base in Redding. These complex scenarios involve multiple air tanker drops, helicopter crew deployment simulations, Forest Service smoke jumper drills, air tanker reload exercises, and on-the-ground role players acting as engines, hand crews, and other ground forces.

To be prepared for large incidents, annual training for pilots, crews, and those supporting military aircraft modified for firefighting also takes place. This year, we welcomed participants from across the US (Florida, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington) and even internationally (New South Wales, Australia).

Content: Nestled in the heart of Northern California’s Sacramento Valley, Butte County consists of 1,677 square miles of valleys, rolling hills, and the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. Known for its diverse agriculture industry, Butte County ranks among the top counties in the state for rice and walnut production.

In 1929, Butte County established the North Butte Fire Protection District. That state contract has evolved into what is today known as the @CALFIRE_ButteCo (BTU). BTU now provides fire protection and emergency services for 105,000 North State residents in the unincorporated portions of Butte County and the cities of Oroville, Gridley, Biggs, and the Town of Paradise. To fulfill our all-risk mission, BTU operates 23 fire stations and employs more than 400 people during peak summer staffing, responding to more than 22,000 calls for service each year.

The Butte Unit is also home to the Chico Air Attack Base and the Magalia and Table Mountain Fire Centers. These Fire Centers serve as the base of operations for four California Conservation Corps and three Firefighter I hand crews. Additionally, the Butte County Fire Department supports 17 volunteer companies.

Fun Fact: Butte County is home to the Oroville Dam, which is the tallest dam in the United States and forms Lake Oroville, the second-largest reservoir in California.

Let us hear from you! If you’re a resident of Butte County, give a shoutout to CAL FIRE BTU in the comments. Show your support and share any stories or photos you have!

Don’t forget to use the hashtag #CALFIREUnitShoutout to join the conversation and let us know your thoughts. Together, let’s celebrate the heroes of CAL FIRE BTU and all they do to keep our community safe. #ButteCounty

Content: In the 1980s prescribed or controlled fire was used for agriculture, brush management, and timber understory maintenance. It was a tool to reduce fuel buildup by maintaining productive forests and reducing brushlands in California.  

There was a decline in the use of prescribed fire that increased the fuel build up which resulted in more available combustible material and larger fires during drought and dryer winters.  Ranchers, State agencies, and large forest landowners decreased the use of burning on the landscape scale with an increase in burn suspension laws, air quality regulations and infrastructure development.  These changes evolved to create the use of a more technical plan and technical burn practitioners to accomplish fuel reduction using prescribed fire.

Today, we use prescribed fire, managed fire, and cultural burning, together known as “beneficial fire” to manage grass, brush, and timber understory for fuel reduction.    One of the cornerstones of forest and land management across California is the increased pace and scale of beneficial fire. As we witness more climate change and the increase in large fires developing into what we know today as “Mega” fires causing catastrophic damage to communities and forestland it is even more important to get beneficial fire back on the landscape.  The advancements in fire ecology, research and development of technology, and the use of traditional burning provide expertise in the use of beneficial fire.  These fuel reduction activities help to decrease the catastrophic fire potential for communities with the increase of strategic fuel breaks, roadway clearance, chipping, mastication, forest thinning, and pile burning.   These efforts create fuel breaks that change fire behavior, reduce negative ecosystem impacts, and enable firefighters to better protect communities.

Content: The “Board of Forestry and Fire Protection,” created in 1885, is the subject of this #CALFIREClassic. 

While charged with developing forest policy and protecting the state’s resources, the three-person body – a first in the nation – served only in an educational and advisory role.

Over the years, the powers of the body evolved into their current roles. The Board is “responsible for developing the general forest policy of the state, determining the guidance policies of the Department, and representing the state's interest in federal forestland in California.”

As dictated by statute, the nine-member board is comprised of five members of the general public, three from the forest products industry, and one member from the range livestock industry. All are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.

The current board meets monthly and is chaired by Terrence O’Brien, a former chairperson of the Sierra Nevada Conservancy who also served in multiple senior roles within state agencies. 

The Board works on pressing issues in the state related to forestry, including the development of a sustainable timber harvest program, the management of healthy and resilient forests, and the promotion of residential wildfire protection.

The images shared depict the 2017 Board of Forestry’s Field Tour within the Fresno Kings Unit.

Content: 🌞Happy First Day of Summer from Captain Cal and CAL FIRE!  🚒🔥

Hey friends, Captain Cal here! As the summer heats up, let's make sure we stay safe, stay prepared, and prevent wildfires. 

Follow these tips ensure your best summer yet:
•Campfire Caution: Always check local regulations before lighting a campfire. Keep it small, contained, and completely extinguished before leaving. 🔥❌
•BBQ Safety: Only use BBQ grills in safe, open areas. Keep a close eye on your grill and have a fire extinguisher nearby. 🍔🌭
•Mowing & Trimming: Mow before 10 a.m. and avoid using metal blades on dry, and don’t mow on windy days. Sparks from equipment can start a fire! 🚜🌾
•Vehicle Safety: Don't park on dry grass. Hot exhaust pipes and mufflers can ignite dry vegetation. Always carry a fire extinguisher in your car. 🚗🔥
•Fireworks: Remember, fireworks can cause devastating wildfires or injury. In many areas of the state fireworks are illegal, so please check local restrictions and choose public firework displays instead. 🎆🚫
•Emergency Kit: Keep an emergency kit ready with essentials like water, non-perishable food, medications, and important documents. Be prepared! 🆘🧳
•Report Fires: If you see a fire, call 911immediately. Early reporting can save lives and property. Report any suspicious activity. 📞🔥
Be fire safe and have a fantastic summer!

Content: As crews continued to build containment lines around the #WhiteFire, confidence in the low chance of spread grew. However, a trend of spillover into an island of grass and brush was noticed. With the help of the @CAL_FIRE  Incident Management Team 1, it was determined that a burn would be the safest course of action to reduce the risk of reignition and provide safer firefighting tactics.

To execute this, 4,000 plastic sphere dispensers, known in the fire service as "dragon eggs," were deployed from helicopters to ignite the fire on the island. Safety measures were in place to ensure the fire remained contained within the fireline.

Air operations successfully completed the burn within the perimeter over 2-and-a-half-day period, minimizing fuel and significantly decreasing the threat and likelihood of fire spread.

#CritialFireWeather conditions exist across much of California with dry lightning expected to be most concentrated at higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and in eastern Southern California. 

Lightning strikes are responsible for four of California's most destructive fires wildfire. 
Please use with fire during this period:
•Stay Informed: Monitor local weather updates and wildfires statewide at: https://t.co/hghLWGavqF.
•Prepare Your Home: Clear flammable materials from roofs, gutters, and around your property.
•Avoid Outdoor Activities: Don't use equipment that could spark a fire. Postpone outdoor activities in forested areas.
•Report Fires: If you see smoke or flames, call 911 immediately.
•Be Ready to Evacuate: Have an emergency kit ready, know your evacuation routes, and sign up for emergency alerts in your area here: https://t.co/YrCBtr5QkA

Content: As Californians, we know the adage, “But it’s a dry heat.” While that helps us feel cooler than in a high heat and humidity environment, it also significantly increases the likelihood of wildfires. 

Here is why:
Dry Vegetation: 🌿 In our California ecosystem, plants and grasses dry out faster when humidity is low. Dry vegetation acts as tinder, making it much easier for fires to ignite and spread rapidly.

Faster Fire Spread: 🔥 Low humidity means less moisture in the air to slow down the spread of flames. Fires can move quickly, covering more ground and becoming harder to control.

Wind Factor: 💨 Low humidity often accompanies windy conditions. These winds can carry embers far from the original fire, sparking new fires in dry areas.

Prolonged Peak Fire Activity: 🌾 California’s diverse landscapes, from forests to grasslands, are all affected by low humidity. The extended dry periods lengthen fire risk periods.

Now that we know why California is at high fire risk, here is what you can do to reduce the threat to your family and community:

• Clear Defensible Space: Keep a safe perimeter around your home by clearing dry brush and debris. 
• Stay Informed: Follow CAL FIRE updates and be aware of local fire conditions.
 • Report Fires Immediately: If you see smoke or fire, call 911 right away. 
• Learn more at: https://t.co/xAsi7kicHn

Together, we can help reduce the risk and impact of wildfires. Stay safe, California! 🌲🚒

🌲 If you or someone you know owns a large parcel or parcels of forestland with a dozen or more well-spaced mature trees, consider the CAL FIRE Reforestation Because of YOU program.

#CALFIRE staff conducts a site visit in June-August to assess that trees meet the criteria for collection. If a cone crop is located, CAL FIRE will monitor and send climbers to collect when the crop is ripe. 

This seed will help us reforest burned land, and participating landowners get to keep a portion of the clean seed!

Content: Recently, the UC Cooperative Extension and @CALFIREAEU held the El Dorado Tree School at the El Dorado Center in Placerville. 

🌳✨ Eager to learn, landowners gathered to explore proper burning techniques, financial assistance programs, and more. 🔥💰

The unique approach blended traditional education with hands-on experience in the great outdoors, fostering a deeper connection to nature and a heightened focus on fire safety. 🌲🏞️ Did you know? 40% of California is privately owned, with most of the State Responsibility Areas (SRA) consisting of private lands. 🏡🌿

CAL FIRE places importance on funding this program because private forestland owners often need technical assistance and support to learn about forest management and how to manage their land for different objectives like timber, recreation, and wildlife. 🪵🏕️

Some 200 aircraft have been available to fight wildfires in June and July. That figure includes CAL FIRE aircraft, plus contract air tankers and water-dropping helicopters. ✈️💦

CAL FIRE's expanded ability to drop water at night is significant because it allows us to extend the firefight past sunset. This allows us to keep most 95 percent of wildfires to under 10 acres or less. 🌙🚒

Do your part and be fire-safe in the outdoors. Remember, One Less Spark means One Less Wildfire. 🔥🌲

Content: The Lumpkin Fire in Butte County was identified at 8:17 p.m. on July 4 -- one of 232 fires to ignite across a blistering hot California.

Thanks to the quick work by @CALFIRE_ButteCo  - including night water drops from a CAL FIRE S70i Firehawk  -- the threat was quickly extinguished -- reaching just 7.5 acres.

CAL FIRE's expanded night operations capability allows us and our partners to undertake night drops on multiple fires during one evening.

The Lumpkin Fire is an example of the aggressive actions of CAL FIRE and our partners to quickly extinguish wildfires during an unusually active early fire season -- with 145,000 acres burned already.

We need Californians to do their part and be fire-safe. Remember One Less Spark, means One Less Wildfire.

🔥 The extremely hot weather dries out plant material, increasing the risk of wildfire.

"Science has shown us how beneficial therapy dogs can be. Visits from a therapy dog can lower blood pressure and heart rate, reduce patient anxiety, and increase levels of endorphins and oxytocin," according to the American Kennel Club.

While the use of therapy dogs in other settings has become widespread, CAL FIRE is now using short visits to boost morale and benefit the mental health of firefighters battling the blaze and support staff supporting the effort.

Content: When a fire becomes too complex for our units to manage, CAL FIRE and our partners deploy specialized Incident Management Teams (IMTs) to take over. This year alone, we've activated 11 IMTs due to the dramatic upsurge in fire activity.

Currently, we’re facing a unique scenario with the #ParkFire: two CAL FIRE IMTs are tackling the same blaze! IMT 3 is operating out of Chico, while IMT 4 is based in Red Bluff. 

The dual activation allows the Unified Command to deploy and support the over 6,300 personnel assigned to the fire. That includes more than 40 helicopters, 500 engines, 180 dozers, 140 water tenders, and 120 handcrews. 

The unique challenge of the state’s fourth-largest fire requires flexibility and CAL FIRE is up to the challenge. 
Two teams, one mission - working together to achieve containment of the fire.

Content: It is not too often that the captain of the USS Enterprise lends his talents to forest conservation here on Earth! 

In April 1987, William Shatner boosted awareness for CAL FIRE's California Forest Improvement Program (CFIP) by narrating an educational video on the program and the importance of protecting our forests. 

His support helped the program thrive, promoting forest conservation for private landowners. 

Today, the program continues to encourage private and public investment in and improved management of California forest lands and resources. 🌲

Content: Multiple fires burning in Southern California -- including the #LineFire, #BridgeFire, and #AirportFire -- are negatively impacting air quality for much of the region. Poor air quality can affect your health. 

Here’s how to stay safe when the air is smoky:
1. Check Local Air Quality: Stay up-to-date on the air quality by checking https://t.co/fUcWC2CEJh.
2. Stay Indoors: Limit outdoor activities and keep windows and doors closed to reduce exposure to smoke.
3. Use Air Purifiers: If possible, use a portable air purifier or run your air conditioning on recirculate to help clean the indoor air.
4. Wear a Mask: If you need to go outside, consider wearing an N95 mask, which can filter out harmful smoke particles.
5. Take Care of Vulnerable People: Check on family, friends, and neighbors—especially those with health conditions, older adults, and young children.
6. Prepare Now: Know your evacuation routes and pack essentials in case the air quality worsens or you're ordered to evacuate.

Flying a drone near a wildfire can be extremely dangerous to pilots and aircraft in the immediate area. Valuable firefighting aircraft can be grounded due to these actions, impeding the chance to quickly extinguish a fire. Yesterday on the Line Fire, there were 2 separate drone incursions into the fire area. These actions not only endanger lives but can carry severe penalties for the individuals responsible. Always remember, if you fly, we can’t. #LineFire

Content: High winds and low humidity are triggering a #RedFlagWarning for large portions of California this week, so it’s a good time to remind people to avoid doing the Right Thing the Wrong Way.

Did you know that motorists are a major cause of wildfires along roadways? Don’t let a simple mistake spark a disaster. Secure your chains properly and make sure nothing is dragging on the ground when you tow. Even a tiny spark can ignite dry grass along a roadside, risking lives and property.
*Use proper hitch pins and hitch balls to keep chains from dragging.
* Check your vehicle for loose parts that could scrape the road.
Let’s all do our part to prevent wildfires!

Content: Earlier this month, at the Living with Fire Summit hosted by the Community Environmental Council, fire experts and local officials gathered to discuss ways to adapt to wildfire risks in our communities.
Key takeaways included:
• Defensible Space: Homeowners can build a 5-foot buffer zone around their homes, free of flammable materials, to slow down fires and protect against embers.
• Prescribed Burns: Controlled burns are essential for reducing fuel that feeds wildfires. These methods help prevent severe fire spread and smoke output.
• Embracing New Landscapes: Fire-safe spaces challenge traditional landscaping ideas, but studies show they're vital to protect homes.
• Tech for Awareness: Enhanced situational tools, like cameras and real-time updates, can keep residents informed and safer during fire events.
As we adapt to a changing environment, we must work together to build a community that’s prepared, resilient, and fire-aware. Let’s spread awareness and support each other in this ongoing journey toward a safer future.

Content: Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches are in effect across many parts of California from 11 AM Tuesday through 7 AM Thursday due to strong offshore winds, near-critical relative humidity with poor overnight recovery, and dry fuels. These conditions pose a significant fire risk across both coastal and inland areas. As a reminder, California’s 2024 fire season runs through December 31, 2024.

Some of California's most devastating wildfires have occurred in late autumn and early winter, particularly in November and December. Every dry, windy day up until then holds the potential for wildfires. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and make sure you’re prepared.

This month, make sure your house has a carbon monoxide detector and that it works! Replace your carbon monoxide detectors every 5-7 years, or when the alarm indicates it's at the end of its life to maintain home safety. 

Practice a family evacuation plan so everyone knows what to do if the alarm sounds. With collective action, we can make our world safer and healthier for all.  #COAwareness #SafetyFirst

Content: Faulty lights and placing heat sources too close to a Christmas tree are among the leading causes of tree fires during the holidays. Once a fire starts, it can quickly spread, endangering gifts, curtains, your entire home, and your loved ones.
Follow these tips to help ensure a safe holiday season:
• Pick a fresh tree with vibrant, green needles.
• Regularly water your tree to prevent it from drying out.
• Avoid setting up the tree near fireplaces, radiators, or heating vents.
• Use only undamaged, tree-approved lights.
• Turn off holiday lights before going to sleep or leaving the home.

Content: The CAL FIRE Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit (NEU) @CALFIRENEU protects the diverse landscapes of Nevada, Yuba, Placer, Sierra, and Sutter counties, including the Sierra Nevada mountains, foothills, and vast river canyons. Also, since 1952, NEU has proudly served as the Placer County Fire Department under a Cooperative Fire Protection agreement.

Established in the 1930’s, CAL FIRE NEU has direct responsibility for fire protection of approximately 1.2 million acres and serves over 650,000 residents. NEU staffs 17 fire stations, two conservation camps, the California National Guard fire crew program, three firefighting dozers, the Grass Valley Emergency Command Center / 911 Dispatch Center, and the Grass Valley Air Attack Base, one of the oldest and most active air attack bases in the state.

Fun Fact: Placer County is home to the famous Lake Tahoe, which is one of the clearest large lakes in the world, with water so clear that you can see down to a depth of up to 70 feet in some areas. Lake Tahoe also attracts approximately 15 million visitors annually. In 1960, NEU served as the fire department for the 1960 Winter Olympic Games held in Lake Tahoe.

We want to hear from you! If you’re a resident of Nevada, Yuba, Placer, Sierra, or Sutter County, give a shoutout to CAL FIRE NEU in the comments. Show your support and share any stories/photos you have.

Don’t forget to use the hashtag #CALFIREUnitShoutout to join the conversation and let us know your thoughts. Together, let’s celebrate the heroes of CAL FIRE NEU and all they do to keep their communities safe.

Content: Curious about the differences between smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires? Let’s break it down!

While both produce smoke, prescribed fires are a key tool in preventing catastrophic wildfires by restoring California’s natural fire cycles. These treatments are carefully planned to reduce health and environmental impacts, in contrast to the dense, long-lasting smoke from uncontrolled wildfires.

Stay informed by downloading the California Smoke Spotter app for local updates and tips to protect yourself from smoke. For live fire, smoke, and haze forecasts, and to see where prescribed fires are happening across the state, visit the CAL FIRE incident map at https://t.co/hghLWG9XB7. Together, we can protect our health and our environment!
